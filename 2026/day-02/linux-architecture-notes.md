I have leanred that linux is operating system and 90% servers we manager are run on linux for the devops.
it has good command on cli and automation scope through scripting

#Basic commands
1. cd - to change the directoty
2. ls - list the file/folder in the current directoty
3. mkdir - creates the directory
4. rm -  remove/delete the file
5. cp - cpoty the file/folder from one location to another (cp source destination )
